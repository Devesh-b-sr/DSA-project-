# DSA-project-
This C++ project uses Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path in an undirected, weighted graph, simulating a simplified navigation system. Implemented with linked lists, it manages nodes and edges efficiently. Features include graph printing, user input for start/end points, and a dynamic shortest path display.
